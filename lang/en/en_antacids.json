Usually, this is just after meals or before you go to bed.<br><br>\nIt’s recommended to take antacids as advised by a clinician or as directed in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. If you are prescribed any other medication, you should allow a 2-hour window on either side of taking an antacid, as it can affect absorption in the gut."
